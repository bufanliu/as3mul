The AS3 Multiuser Library is a (professional-grade?) Flash peer to peer (game?) framework built using Adobe Cirrus with ease of use and  scalability in mind. The AS3 Multiuser Library (AS3MUL) was built to allow developers to quickly and easily create multi-player flash games and applications without worrying about p2p connection architecture.

AS3MUL comes ready to use (only requiring you to have your Cirrus developer key ready) with sample applications which you can use as a foundation to build your own multi player apps and games. The sample applications are also a great way to learn how to use the library.
